# ECC with ECDF and AES GCM

This is a practical implementation of elliptic curve cryptography using ECDF and prime256v1, with AES in GCM mode, in python.

This implementation is not guaranteed to be correct.

The only purpose of this implementation is to show a practical explained example of ECC in use.
